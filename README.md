Hello. My name is Tetiana.


I  want to thank you for this course. 


Before, I started to study something in frontend, but it was not systematic. And as a result, I did not get extensive knowledge. 


Now I hope to get knowledge step by step.

As for me, HTTP is quite difficult topic to understand, but very important. I learned a lot of HyperText Transfer Protocol, but I want to come back to this topic later
