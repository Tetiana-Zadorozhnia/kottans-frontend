Hello. My name is Tetiana.


I  want to thank you for this course. 


Before, I started to study something in frontend, but it was not systematic. And as a result, I did not get extensive knowledge. 


Now I hope to get knowledge step by step

## **0. Git and GitHub**
I liked information about git - it was difficult, but interesting. In the future, I want to understand more and apply it in practice.

 ## **1. Linux CLI, and HTTP**
It was my first introduction to Linux operating system. The information was interesting. I got to know the basic Linux commands. The interactive form made it easy to remember them

#### ***3. [HTTP: Протокол, який повинен розуміти кожний веб-розробник - Частина 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)***

As for me, HTTP is quite difficult topic to understand, but very important. I learned a lot of HyperText Transfer Protocol, but I want to come back to this topic later

## **2. Git Collaboration**
Before, I didn't use GitHub. It seemed a complicated web service. 

However, the lessons helped to understand in more detail and remember enough commands to interact with GitHub.

I will use this web service in the future. Since, it opens up wide possibilities

## **3. Intro to HTML and CSS**
I already knew a bit about HTML and CSS. However, it was useful to refresh knowledge.

I enjoyed the lessons on Codecademy. I was surprised why I didn't find these lessons earlier. Combining theory with practice is great.

I will certainly use HTML and CSS in the future.
