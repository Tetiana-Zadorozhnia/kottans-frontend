### Hello. My name is Tetiana
### I  want to thank you for this course. 
### Before, I started to study something in frontend, but it was not systematic. And as a result, I did not get extensive knowledge. 
### Now I hope to get knowledge step by step.

# ***1.Git Basics***
### I liked information about git - it was difficult, but interesting. In future, I want to understand more and apply it in practice.
